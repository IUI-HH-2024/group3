            <h2>Evolution of Hardware</h2>
            <p>The evolution of hardware, or gaming consoles, has rapidly progressed to the stage we have now. It evolved from the first home arcade gaming consoles to mobile games and consoles you can carry, connect to the television or the phone, and play with others. It evolved from Sega Master System to Sega Dreamcast, from the first Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) to WIIU and Nintendo Switch, from the first PlayStation to PlayStation 5, and even Xbox to Xbox Series X. Now, we are approaching virtual reality gaming console headsets. The space provided has also evolved with the gaming consoles</p>

            <h2>Evolution of Software</h2>
            <p>The software, or games, have evolved from the first AI (Artificial Intelligence) games, in chess or mathematical games, to arcades. Evolution really took off once the internet came into being, and the world slowly started to connect. People no longer had to play games solo or take turns at home or in public with other players. Instead, multiplayer was introduced and swiftly became increasingly popular. Games evolved from games like Sonic rings to Sonic racing, from Super Mario Bros (a platform game) to something more with racing, multiplayer adventure, a more 2D or 3D world. </p>

            <h2>Role of Platforms and Tools in Creating Communities</h2>
            <p>Discord</p>
            <p>Streaming Services like Twitch</p>

            <h2>Future Developments</h2>
            <p>Honestly, the gaming industry progresses quickly and freezes just as quickly. It is highly reliant on the interests of the audience and the work power provided. The world of gaming consoles is constantly improving, trying to provide more space, more options with worldwide interaction, more apps, and more games. The games themselves are also constantly evolving, containing more AI to prevent cheating, to create more interactions in the game worlds, to pave the way for virtual worlds being created for players. Esports themselves are also becoming more popular, with both gamers and those who just like to watch. It is becoming more recognized as a career and part of the community. AR (augmented reality) and VR (virtual reality) are slowly taking over the gaming industry and promise developments in leaps and bounds in hardware, software, and platforms.</p>
